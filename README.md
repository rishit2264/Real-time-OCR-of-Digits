# Real-time-OCR-of-Digits
Utilization of deep learning techniques for real-time digit recognition (e.g., from a camera feed). 

# Python  Implementation

1) Dataset- MNIST dataset
2) Images of size 28 X 28
3) Classify digits from 0 to 9
4) Logistic Regression, Shallow Network and Deep Network Support added.

# Test Acuracy ~ 90 to 98%

# Execution for showing images through webcam
To run the code, type `python Digit-Recognizer.py`  in command prompt after directing to the path
